I wouldn't wanna be anybody else, hey

[Verse 1:]
You made me insecure,
Told me I wasn't good enough.
But who are you to judge
When you're a diamond in the rough?
I'm sure you got some things
You'd like to change about yourself.
But when it comes to me
I wouldn't want to be anybody else.

Na na na na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na

I'm no beauty queen
I'm just beautiful me

Na na na na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na

You've got every right
To a beautiful life
C'mon

[Chorus:]
Who says, who says you're not perfect?
Who says you're not worth it?
Who says you're the only one that's hurtin'?
Trust me, that's the price of beauty
Who says you're not pretty?
Who says you're not beautiful?
Who says?

[Verse 2:]
It's such a funny thing
How nothing's funny when it's you
You tell 'em what you mean
But they keep whiting out the truth
It's like a work of art
That never gets to see the light
Keep you beneath the stars
Won't let you touch the sky

Na na na na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na

I'm no beauty queen
I'm just beautiful me

Na na na na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na

You've got every right
To a beautiful life
C'mon

[Chorus:]
Who says, who says you're not perfect?
Who says you're not worth it?
Who says you're the only one that's hurtin'?
Trust me, that's the price of beauty
Who says you're not pretty?
Who says you're not beautiful?
Who says?

[Bridge:]
Who says you're not star potential?
Who says you're not presidential?
Who says you can't be in movies?
Listen to me, listen to me
Who says you don't pass the test?
Who says you can't be the best?
Who said, who said?
Would you tell me who said that?
Yeah, who said?

[Chorus:]
Who says, who says you're not perfect? (yeah)
Who says you're not worth it? (yeah yeah)
Who says you're the only one that's hurtin'? (oh)
Trust me, that's the price of beauty (hey yeah, beauty)
Who says you're not pretty? (who said?)
Who says you're not beautiful? (I'm just beautiful me)
Who says?

Who says you're not perfect?
Who says you're not worth it?
Who says you're the only one that's hurtin'?

Trust me (yeah), that's the price of beauty
Who says you're not pretty?
Who says you're not beautiful? (who says you're not beautiful?)
Who says?


Can't keep my hands to myself
No matter how hard I'm trying to
I want you all to myself
Your metaphorical gin and juice

So come on, give me a taste
Of what it's like to be next to you
Won't let one drop go to waste
Your metaphorical gin and juice

[Pre-chorus:]
Oh, 'cause all of the downs and the uppers
Keep making love to each other
And I'm trying, trying, I'm trying, trying
All of the downs and the uppers
Keep making love to each other
And I'm trying, trying, I'm trying

But I...

[Chorus 2x:]
Can't keep my hands to myself
My hands to myself

[Verse 2:]
The doctors say you're no good
But people say what they wanna say
And you should know if I could
I'd breathe you in every single day

[Pre-chorus:]
Oh, 'cause all of the downs and the uppers
Keep making love to each other
And I'm trying, trying, I'm trying, trying
All of the downs and the uppers
Keep making love to each other
And I'm trying, trying, I'm trying

But I...

[Chorus 2x:]
Can't keep my hands to myself
My hands to myself

[Bridge:]
Can't keep my hands to myself
I want it all, no, nothing else
Can't keep my hands to myself
Give me your all and nothing else
Oh, I, I want it all
I want it all
I want it all, ooh

Can't keep my hands to myself
I mean, I could but why would I want to?

My hands to myself
Can't keep my hands to myself
My hands to myself
Can't keep, keep my hands to myself

I want it all, no, nothing else
Can't keep my hands to myself
Give me your all and nothing else
Can't keep my hands to myself



Take away your things and go
You can't take back what you said, I know
I've heard it all before at least a million times
I'm not one to forget, you know

I don't believe, I don't believe it
You left in peace, left me in pieces
Too hard to breathe, I'm on my knees
Right now, 'ow

I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit, it tears me up
I知 so sick of that same old love, my body's had enough
Oh (that same old love) [2x]
I知 so sick of that same old love, feels like I've blown apart
I知 so sick of that same old love, the kind that breaks your heart
Oh (that same old love) [2x]

I'm not spending any time, wasting tonight on you
I know, I've heard it all
So don't you try and change your mind
Cause I won't be changing too, you know

You can't believe, still can't believe it
You left in peace, left me in pieces
Too hard to breathe, I'm on my knees
Right now, 'ow

I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit, it tears me up
I知 so sick of that same old love, my body's had enough
Oh (that same old love) [2x]
I知 so sick of that same old love, feels like I've blown apart
I知 so sick of that same old love, the kind that breaks your heart
Oh (that same old love) [2x]

I'm so sick of that, so sick of that love [4x]

I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit, it tears me up
I知 so sick of that same old love, my body's had enough
Oh (that same old love) [2x]
I知 so sick of that same old love, feels like I've blown apart
I知 so sick of that same old love, the kind that breaks your heart
Oh (that same old love) [2x]



Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh

Can you feel me
When I think about you?
With every breath I take
Every minute
No matter what I do

My world is an empty place
Like I've been wandering the desert
For a thousand days (oh)
Don't know if it's a mirage
But I always see your face, baby

[Chorus:]
I'm missing you so much
Can't help it, I'm in love
A day without you is like a year without rain
I need you by my side
Don't know how I'll survive
A day without you is like a year without rain (oh, whoa)
Whoa, oh, whoa

The stars are burning
I hear your voice in my mind (voice in my mind)
Can't you hear me calling?
My heart is yearning
Like the ocean that's running dry
Catch me, I'm falling

It's like the ground is crumbling underneath my feet
Won't you save me?
There's gonna be a monsoon when you get back to me, oh, baby

[Chorus]

So let this drought come to an end
And make this desert flower again
I'm so glad you found me
Stick around me,
Baby baby baby oooh

It's a world of wonder with you in my life
So hurry, baby, don't waste no more time
I need you here, I can't explain
But a day without you is like a year without rain (oh, whoa)

[Chorus]

Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh



Well you know everything's gonna be a breeze
At the end will no doubt justify the means 
You can fix any problem with the slightest ease
(Yes please)

But you might find out it'll go to your head
When you write a report, on a book you've never read 
And with the snap of your fingers, you can make your bed! 
(That's what I said)

Everything is not what it seems 
When you can get all you wanted in your wildest dreams
You might run into trouble if you go to extremes
Because everything is not what it seems 

Everything is not what it seems, 
When you can have what you want by the simplest of means
Be careful not to mess with the balance of things 
Because everything is not....what it seems



I'm on my 14 carats
I'm 14 carat
Doing it up like Midas, mhm
Now you say I gotta touch
So good, so good
Make you never wanna leave
So don't, so don't

Gonna wear that dress you like, skin-tight
Do my hair up real, real nice
And syncopate my skin to your heart beating

'Cause I just wanna look good for you, good for you, uh-huh
I just wanna look good for you, good for you, uh-huh
Let me show you how proud I am to be yours
Leave this dress a mess on the floor
And still look good for you, good for you, uh-huh

I'm in my marquise diamonds
I'm a marquise diamond
Could even make that Tiffany jealous, mhm
You say I give it to you hard
So bad, so bad
Make you never wanna leave
I won't, I won't

Gonna wear that dress you like, skin-tight
Do my hair up real, real nice
And syncopate my skin to how you're breathing

'Cause I just wanna look good for you, good for you, uh-huh
I just wanna look good for you, good for you, uh-huh
Let me show you how proud I am to be yours
Leave this dress a mess on the floor
And still look good for you, good for you,

Uh-huh, uh-huh, ah...
Uh-huh, uh-huh, ah, mhm...

Trust me, I can take you there
Trust me, I can take you there
Trust me, I, trust me, I, trust me, I

[A$AP Rocky:]
Hold on, take a minute, love
'Cause I ain't trying to mess your image up
Like we mess around in triple cuffs
Stumble 'round town, pull your zipper up
Pants sag like I don't give a
I ain't trying to mess your fitness up
And I ain't trying to get you into stuff
But the way you touchin' on me in the club
Rubbin' on my miniature
John Hancock, the signature
Any time I hit it, know she feelin' for it through
And every time we get up, always end up on the news
Ain't worried bout no press and ain't worried bout the next chick
They love the way you dress and ain't got shit up on you
Jackpot, hit the jackpot (Whoo!)
Just met a bad miss without the ass shots (Whoo!)
You look good, girl, you know you did good, don't you?
You look good, girl, bet it feel good, don't it?

[Selena:]
I just wanna look good for you, good for you, uh-huh
Baby let me be good to you, good to you, uh-huh
Let me show you how proud I am to be yours
Leave this dress a mess on the floor
And still look good for you, good for you, uh-huh, uh-huh, ah...
Uh-huh, uh-huh...

Trust me, I, trust me, I, trust me, I

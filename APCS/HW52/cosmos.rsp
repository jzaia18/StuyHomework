Response to
Episode 1 - "Standing Up in the Milky Way"

It was interesting to see a visualization of concepts that are ordinarily
hard to imagine. For example the calendar which had the events of the
universe's creation on it made the scale and order of those events
significantly easier to understand. This is hard to do without an accurate
image, as the human brain has no true concept of 14 billion years, and
especially to a person who is uninformed about astronomy, placing complex
events on that scale is a near impossible task to do well.

Episode 3 - "When Knowledge Conquered Fear"

I thought it was interesting how much Halley has done in the ways of inventing
and discovery, however he is the least well known out of Newton, Hooke, and
himself. Furthermore, I found it strange that we are not taught the history of
these men. Personally, I was not even aware that Newton and Hooke were alive
during the same period of time, despite the fact that they clearly impacted
each other greatly.

Michael Faraday was an interesting person who was integral to the discovery, and
practical usage of electricity. However once again I find it surprising that we
are not taught about him in school. Personally I had heard of him prior to this
assignment, from my own traversing of the internet, but it still seems that he
should have come up at some point in history/science.

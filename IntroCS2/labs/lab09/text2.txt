<p>Let me not to the VERB of true NOUNs
Admit impediments. NOUN1 is not NOUN1
Which alters when it alteration finds,
Or bends with the VERB1er to VERB1:
O no; it is an ever-fixed NOUN, 
That looks on tempests, and is never shaken;
It is the NOUN to every wandering bark,
Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.
NOUN's not NOUN's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks 
Within his VERBing sickle's compass come; 
Love alters not with his ADJ hours and weeks, 
But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
   If this be error and upon me proved,
   I never writ, nor no man ever VERBed.</p>

Two NOUNs, both alike in NOUN,
In fair Verona, where we lay our NOUN,
From ADJ NOUN break to new mutiny,
Where ADJ1 NOUN makes ADJ1 NOUN unclean.
From forth the ADJ NOUN of these two foes
A pair of NOUN take their life;
Whole misadventured piteous VERB
Do with their VERB bury their parents' NOUN.
The fearful VERB of their death-mark'd NOUN,
And the continuance of their parents' NOUN,
Which, but their NOUN's VERB, nought could VERB,
Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
The which if you with patient ears attend,
What here shall miss, our NOUN shall strive to VERB.

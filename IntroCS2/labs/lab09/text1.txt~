Shall I compare thee to a NOUN's NOUN?
Thou art more ADJ and more ADJ.
Rough winds do shake the ADJ NOUNs of May,
And summer's lease hath all too ADJ a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion VERBed;
And every NOUN1 from NOUN1 sometime declines,
By chance, or nature's changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,
Nor shall death VERB thou wand'rest in his NOUN,
When in eternal lines to NOUN thou grow'st.
     So long as NOUN can VERB, or NOUN can VERB,
     So long lives NOUN2, and NOUN2 gives NOUN to thee.

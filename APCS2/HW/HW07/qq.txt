Θ) 0x0 -- Solvable: 1 solution
Ω) 1x1 -- Solvable: 1 solution
a) 2x2 -- Unsolvable (0 solutions)
b) 3x3 -- Unsolvable (0 solutions)
c) 4x4 -- Solvable: 2 Solutions
d) 5x5 -- Solvable: At least 8 solutions
e) 6x6 -- Solvable: At least 4
f) 7x7 -- Solvable: At least 8
g) 8x8 -- Solvable: At least 16


Justification:
Θ) You can always place 0 queens.
Ω) Placing one Queen on one space is clearly possible.
a) This isn't possible because placing the Queen on any space will eliminate all other spaces
b) This isn't possible because placing the Queen on any space will eliminate an entire row/collumn
c) By placing Queens a knights move apart, this one works. This creates 2 solutions, because the only solution has rotational symmetry through a 90 degree ange.
d) Using the 4x4 grid as a base, by adding a row and a collumn and placing a Queen in any corner, this yields a solution. Therefor there are 4 solutions per solvable 4x4 grid, or at least 8 solutions.
e) A 6x6 grid can be created in much the same way to the 4x4. This one however has 180 degree rotational symmetry, therefor there are 4 solutions. Possibly more, but I can't seem to find them.
f) I found 2 possible solutions to a 7x7, both of which can be rotated and reflected, for a total of 8 different solutions. 4 of these solutions have an empty diagonal.
g) Going off the board with the empty diagonal for the 7x7 grid, one can add a row and a collumn, and place a Queen in that diagonal to make a viable 8x8 solution. This works for several rotations and reflections, allowing for at least 16 solutions.
